## Three Axiom Systems

This project uses three overlapping axiom systems. They are not contradictory; they describe the same system at different levels of abstraction.

| System | Count | Date | File | Abstraction Level |
|--------|-------|------|------|-------------------|
| **Formal Axioms (FA)** | 13 | Jan 17, 2026 | `docs/08-reference/archive/AXIOMS.md` | Mathematical properties of cost function |
| **Pipeline Axioms (PA)** | 12 | Feb 2026 | `PATENT_DETAILED_DESCRIPTION.md` S12 | Layer-specific operational invariants |
| **Quantum Axioms (QA)** | 5 | v3.0.0 | `CLAUDE.md`, `axiom_grouped/*.py` | Physics-inspired groupings across layers |

## Cross-Reference Map

### Formal Axiom -> Pipeline Axiom -> Quantum Axiom

| FA# | Formal Axiom | Maps to PA# | Pipeline Axiom | Maps to QA | Verification |
|-----|-------------|-------------|---------------|------------|-------------|
| FA1 | Positivity of Cost | PA12 | Harmonic scaling H(d*,R)=R^((phi*d*)^2) — canonical. Old additive forms RETIRED. | QA4: Symmetry | VERIFIED (431 tests) |
| FA2 | Monotonicity of Deviation | PA12 | Harmonic scaling (monotone in d) | QA4: Symmetry | VERIFIED |
| FA3 | Convexity of Cost Surface | PA12 | H(d,R) strictly convex for d>=0 | QA4: Symmetry | VERIFIED |
| FA4 | Bounded Temporal Breathing | PA8 | Breathing diffeomorphism b(t) | QA3: Causality | VERIFIED (post Jan 19) |
| FA5 | Smoothness (C-infinity) | PA5, PA7 | d_H and Mobius are smooth | QA4: Symmetry | VERIFIED (13/13 tests) |
| FA6 | Lyapunov Stability | PA6 | Breathing converges to safe state | QA3: Causality | VERIFIED (13/13 tests) |

| FA12 | Topological Attack Detection | PA9 | Spectral coherence (PHDM) | QA4: Symmetry | VERIFIED |
| FA13 | Atomic Rekeying | -- | Not in PA (Claim 5 PQC) | -- | VERIFIED |

### Mar 17, 2026 Reference Split Note

Keep these two Layer 12 lanes distinct when adding tests or writing theorem claims:

- `src/scbe_14layer_reference.py::layer_12_harmonic_scaling` is the current bounded reference score:
  Canonical formula (April 2026): `H(d*,R) = R^((phi*d*)^2)` where phi=(1+sqrt(5))/2, R>1 (default e).
- Legacy additive forms `1/(1+d+2*pd)` and `1/(1+phi*d_H+2*pd)` are RETIRED. See `docs/specs/LAYER_12_CANONICAL_FORMULA.md`.

The new focused suite `tests/industry_standard/test_formal_axioms_reference.py`
keeps this split explicit: FA1-FA3 are checked against the legacy wall law,
while FA4/FA7/FA9/FA10/FA12 are checked against the live reference pipeline.

### Pipeline Axioms Not in Formal Axioms

| PA# | Pipeline Axiom | Why No FA Equivalent | Covered By |
|-----|---------------|---------------------|------------|
| PA1 | Complex Context c_k = A_k exp(i phi_k) | Input format, not property | QA5: Composition |
| PA2 | Realification isometry | Transform step, not property | QA1: Unitarity |
| PA4 | Poincare embedding with clamping | Projection step | QA1: Unitarity |
| PA6 | Mobius addition gyrovector | Algebraic operation | QA1: Unitarity |
| PA7 | Phase transform isometry | Isometry guarantee | QA4: Symmetry |
| PA9 | Realm distance 1-Lipschitz | Continuity bound | QA2: Locality |
| PA11 | Triadic temporal distance | Aggregation formula | QA3: Causality |

### Quantum Axiom Coverage

| QA# | Quantum Axiom | Layers | Formal Axiom Coverage | Pipeline Axiom Coverage |
|-----|-------------|--------|----------------------|------------------------|
| QA1 | Unitarity | L2, L4, L7 | FA5 (smoothness) | PA2, PA4, PA7 |
| QA2 | Locality | L3, L8 | FA10 (golden ratio) | PA3, PA9 |
| QA3 | Causality | L6, L11, L13 | FA4 (breathing), FA6 (stability) | PA6, PA8, PA11 |
| QA4 | Symmetry | L5, L9, L10, L12 | FA1-3, FA5, FA7, FA9, FA12 | PA5, PA10, PA12 |
| QA5 | Composition | L1, L14 | -- | PA1 |

## Gap Analysis

### Gaps in Formal Axioms (not covering pipeline concepts)

1. **L11 formalization exists only as a draft, not yet canonicalized** (PA11 / L11). The triadic object `d_tri` is live in the core math and code, and the draft admissibility/residual formalization now exists in `docs/research/2026-03-13-l11-triadic-temporal-axiom-draft.md`, but it has not yet been promoted into the canonical formal axiom set.
2. **No FA for realm assignment** (PA9 / L8). The nearest-centroid assignment d* = min_k d_H(u, mu_k) has no formal axiom.
3. **No FA for input composition** (PA1 / L1, L14). The complex context encoding and audio axis telemetry have no formal axiom.

### Gaps in Pipeline Axioms (not covering formal concepts)

1. **No PA for PQC** (FA8). The dual-lattice consensus (Claim 5) is not among the 12 pipeline axioms A1-A12.
2. **No PA for fractional flux** (FA11). The ODE dynamics (Claim 6/16) are not among A1-A12.
3. **No PA for atomic rekeying** (FA13). The rekeying mechanism (related to Claim 5) is not in A1-A12.

### Recommendation

The formal axioms (FA1-13) and pipeline axioms (A1-A12) are complementary, not contradictory. The FAs describe global mathematical properties; the PAs describe per-layer operational invariants. Both are needed. No unification is required, but this cross-reference should be maintained.
