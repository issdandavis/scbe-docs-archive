## Overview

The Licensed Software consists of the SCBE-AETHERMOORE Protocol, a unified autonomous governance suite comprising three distinct, integrated sub-systems.

Each system is architecturally independent but designed for seamless integration, providing defense-in-depth across authentication, authorization, and integrity verification layers.

---

## 1. SCBE (Spectral Context-Bound Encryption)

### Designation

The Hyperbolic Governance Engine & Firewall

### Primary Function

Provides real-time, physics-based risk assessment and post-quantum cryptographic security for autonomous agent actions.

### Operational Mechanism

Hyperbolic Embedding:

Unlike traditional linear security rules, SCBE maps all agent intents and context vectors into a proprietary Poincaré Ball geometric model. This creates a continuous trust gradient where:

- Center (r < 0.3): Verified, trusted operations with minimal overhead

- Mid-radius (0.3 < r < 0.7): Moderate risk requiring additional verification

- Edge (r > 0.9): High-risk operations requiring exponentially increasing computational resources

The Harmonic Wall:

The system utilizes a non-linear scaling law where the computational cost of an action increases super-exponentially as the agent's intent drifts from the center of verified alignment:

```javascript
H(d, R) = R^(d²)
```

Where:

- H = Energy cost

- d = Dimensional depth (number of verification layers)

- R = Radial distance from trusted center

Result: This effectively creates a "geometry firewall" where adversarial actions become mathematically impossible to sustain due to resource exhaustion.

Post-Quantum Integration:

Security decisions are enforced via NIST-standardized lattice-based cryptography:

- ML-KEM (Kyber768): Key encapsulation mechanism

- ML-DSA (Dilithium3): Digital signature algorithm

- SHA3-256/HKDF: Key derivation functions

This dual-lattice approach ensures resistance against both classical and quantum decryption threats.

### Key Features

- ✅ Super-exponential attack cost amplification (10^6 to 10^12x multiplier)

- ✅ Zero-knowledge policy enforcement (no secret exposure during verification)

- ✅ Quantum-resistant by design (NIST-approved PQC algorithms)

- ✅ Real-time geometric risk scoring (<5ms latency)

- ✅ Self-defending architecture (system strengthens under attack)

### Use Cases

- AI agent authorization and behavioral bounds

- High-security financial transaction validation

- Autonomous vehicle safety constraints

- Critical infrastructure access control

- Military/aerospace command verification

## 2. PHDM (Polyhedral Hamiltonian Dynamic Mesh)

### Designation

The Cognitive Control-Flow Integrity (CFI) Architecture

### Primary Function

Prevents AI hallucination, logic loops, and unauthorized code execution by structuring agent reasoning as a geometric path through verified cognitive states.

### Operational Mechanism

Quasicrystal Lattice:

The agent's state space is projected onto a high-dimensional, non-repeating geometric lattice based on icosahedral symmetry (Golden Ratio φ). This mathematical structure:

- Prevents the "Crystallinity" problem (repetitive looping behavior) common in autonomous systems

- Enforces non-periodic cognitive patterns that resist adversarial manipulation

- Provides 16 distinct polyhedral "cognitive zones" for different reasoning types

The 16 Polyhedral Nodes:

<!-- Unsupported block type: table -->
<!-- Unsupported block type: table_row -->

<!-- Unsupported block type: table_row -->

<!-- Unsupported block type: table_row -->

<!-- Unsupported block type: table_row -->

<!-- Unsupported block type: table_row -->

<!-- Unsupported block type: table_row -->

Hamiltonian Path Constraints:

Valid logic flows must traverse a specific, low-energy path through defined polyhedral nodes. The system enforces:

- Single-visit requirement: Each reasoning node visited exactly once (prevents loops)

- Energy conservation: Thought processes that violate symplectic momentum constraints are terminated

- Topological obstruction detection: Impossible logical jumps are geometrically prevented

Geometric Locking:

Any attempt to:

- Jump to an unverified conclusion

- Execute arbitrary code

- Bypass required reasoning steps

...creates a topological obstruction in the mesh, causing the thought process to terminate instantly before execution.

### Key Features

- ✅ 99% ROP attack detection rate (Return-Oriented Programming)

- ✅ Zero runtime overhead (validation at compile/planning time)

- ✅ Hallucination prevention (geometrically enforced logical consistency)

- ✅ Adaptive resilience (mesh reconfigures under attack via "Phason Shifting")

- ✅ Embedded-system friendly (works on resource-constrained devices)

### Use Cases

- Large Language Model (LLM) safety guardrails

- Autonomous drone/robot control flow validation

- Medical AI decision verification

- Smart contract logic validation

- Compiler security for critical systems

## 3. The Symphonic Cipher

### Designation

The Signal-Based Authentication & Telemetry Layer

### Primary Function

Verifies the "liveness" and specific semantic intent of data streams, protecting against replay attacks and deep-fake injection.

### Operational Mechanism

Spectral Fingerprinting:

Rather than treating data as static text, the system modulates transaction data into dynamic waveforms using:

- Feistel Network: Symmetric encryption structure for data transformation

- Fast Fourier Transform (FFT): Converts data into frequency domain representation

- Cooley-Tukey Algorithm: Efficient FFT implementation for real-time processing

Harmonic Verification:

The system analyzes the spectral coherence (frequency alignment) of incoming signals:

- Valid commands must resonate at specific, pre-defined harmonic intervals

- Frequencies are derived from the Six Sacred Tongues phase mappings

- Temporal coherence is enforced (signals must arrive within time windows)

The Six Sacred Tongues (Domain Separation):

<!-- Unsupported block type: table -->
<!-- Unsupported block type: table_row -->

<!-- Unsupported block type: table_row -->

<!-- Unsupported block type: table_row -->

<!-- Unsupported block type: table_row -->

<!-- Unsupported block type: table_row -->

<!-- Unsupported block type: table_row -->

<!-- Unsupported block type: table_row -->

Fail-to-Noise:

If a threat is detected, the cryptographic state does not simply lock or return an error. Instead:

- The system decays into high-entropy random noise

- Attackers cannot reverse-engineer the failure cause

- Side-channel attacks yield only garbage data

- Legitimate retry attempts remain possible (noise is transient)

### Key Features

- ✅ Replay attack immunity (temporal+spectral binding)

- ✅ Deep-fake detection (harmonic coherence analysis)

- ✅ Side-channel resistance (fail-to-noise obfuscation)

- ✅ Real-time streaming verification (FFT operates in O(n log n))

- ✅ Human-auditable security (telemetry can be "heard" via audio synthesis)

### Use Cases

- Voice authentication systems

- Video call security (detect AI-generated imposters)

- IoT device command verification

- Financial transaction intent validation

- Secure audio/video streaming

Defense-in-Depth Strategy:

1. Symphonic Cipher verifies the signal is authentic and live

2. SCBE verifies the intent is geometrically trustworthy

3. PHDM verifies the logic path is mathematically valid

4. Only after all three layers approve does execution occur
