### Email 1: To Timothy Chung (Former OFFSET PM, Swarm Expert)

**Subject:** Jam-Resistant Swarm Coordination - No RF Required

---

Dr. Chung,

I followed your work on OFFSET and the progress toward field-deployable swarm capabilities. I've developed something that addresses a gap I noticed: **how swarms coordinate when RF is denied**.

**The Problem:** Current swarm coordination fails under jamming because it relies on explicit communication.

**My Solution:** Drones "feel" each other through hyperbolic geometry. Each unit maintains a position in a Poincaré ball and a cryptographic phase signature. Compromised units are detected mathematically - no communication required.

**Key Results (Simulation):**
- Rogue drone detected and quarantined in 1 timestep
- 6/6 consensus, zero false positives
- Formation maintained with RF disabled

**Live Demo:** [YOUR_DEPLOYED_URL]/v1/demo/rogue-detection

I'm a solo developer with a working prototype (950 tests passing, ready for hardware integration). Happy to discuss if this aligns with any current or future swarm programs.

Best,

### Email 2: To Phillip Smith (Lift Challenge PM, TTO)

**Subject:** Swarm Coordination Layer for Multi-Drone Lift Operations

---

Dr. Smith,

Congratulations on launching the Lift Challenge - heavy-lift drones will need coordination to be useful in contested environments.

I've developed a **jam-resistant coordination layer** that could complement heavy-lift capabilities:

**What It Does:**
- Enables swarms to maintain formation without RF communication
- Detects compromised/spoofed units through mathematical anomaly detection
- Works with GPS denied (uses internal geometry only)

**Why It Matters for Lift:**
When multiple drones coordinate for heavy payload delivery, a single compromised unit could cause mission failure. My system detects that unit before it acts.

**Technical Brief:** [Link to DARPA_SWARM_BRIEF.md on GitHub]
**Live Demo:** [YOUR_DEPLOYED_URL]/v1/demo/swarm-coordination?agents=20

Would welcome 15 minutes to discuss if this could support Lift Challenge participants or future TTO programs.

Best,

### Email 3: Generic TTO Inquiry

**Subject:** Novel Swarm Coordination Approach - Seeking Right Program Fit

---

To the Tactical Technology Office,

I've developed a swarm coordination system that operates without RF communication - drones detect each other and identify compromised units through hyperbolic geometry.

**Capability Summary:**
- Jam-resistant: Works under full RF denial
- Rogue detection: Mathematical anomaly detection, 0/15 clean false positives on the current public suite
- Decentralized: No single point of failure
- Proven: 950 tests passing, simulation-validated

**Potential Applications:**
- Contested ISR swarms
- Counter-UAS (detect adversary drones)
- Resilient logistics/resupply
- Urban operations (no RF signature)

I'm seeking guidance on which program or PM this might align with. Happy to provide a technical deep-dive or live demonstration.

Best,

## Your Pitch Points (Use These)

### The Hook
> "Drones that feel each other through math, not radio waves."

### The Problem
> "Current swarm coordination fails when jammed because it relies on RF communication."

### The Solution
> "Hyperbolic geometry embedding where each drone's position encodes trust. Compromised units are mathematically anomalous - detected without any communication."

### The Proof
> "950 tests passing. Rogue detected at step 0 with 6/6 consensus. Zero false positives. Ready for hardware integration."

### The Ask
> "15 minutes to demonstrate the live system and discuss program fit."
